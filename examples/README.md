General Tips
------------

While there is no dearth of good literature on nonlinear time series
analysis, here are a few things that I found to be useful in practical
situations.

1.  Picking a good time delay hinges on balancing redundance and
    irrelevance between the components of the time delayed vectors and
    there are no straightforward theoretical results that help us do
    this. Therefore, always plot two- and three-dimensional phase
    portraits of the reconstructed attractor before settling on a time
    delay and verify that the attractor (or whatever structure appears)
    looks unfolded. Don’t blindly pick values by just looking at the
    delayed mutual information or the autocorrelation function of the
    time series.

2.  If possible, use the Chebyshev metric while computing the
    correlation sum <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>). The Chebyshev metric
    has many advantages, especially when we are trying to evaluate
    <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>) after embedding the time series.

    -   It’s computationally faster than the cityblock and the Euclidean
        metric. For larger data sets, this is an obvious advantage.

    -   Distances are independent of the embedding dimension
        <em>d</em> and always remain bounded as opposed to Euclidean
        and cityblock distances, which crudely go as <em>d<sup>1/2</sup></em> and
        <em>d</em> respectively. This helps in comparing the
        correlation sum plots at different embedding dimensions.

    -   Since the distances always remain bounded, we can evaluate
        <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>) at the same <em>r</em>’s for
        all embedding dimensions. And <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>) at
        <em>r</em><sub>max</sub> = max<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> − min<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>
        is 1 regardless of the embedding dimension. Of course,
        <em>C</em>(<em>r</em>) could be 1 even for
        <em>r</em> &lt; <em>r</em><sub>max</sub>.
        Nonetheless, this helps in choosing a range of <em>r</em>
        values.

3.  Ensure that temporal correlations between points are removed in all
    cases where it is known to result in spurious estimates of dimension
    and/or determinism.

4.  Avoid the skew statistic which attempts to measures asymmetry w.r.t.
    time reversal for detecting nonlinearity. It tells very little about
    the origin of nonlinearity and fails miserably in many cases.

5.  The second FNN test tests for “boundedness” of the reconstructed
    attractor.

6.  When plotting the reconstructed phase space, use same scaling for
    all the axes as all <em>d</em> coordinates are sampled from the
    same distribution.

7.  If the series has a strong periodic component, a reasonable time
    delay is the quarter of the time period.

8.  Some chaotic time series such as those from Lorenz attractor may
    display long-range correlations (because of its “reversing” nature).
    In such cases, a delay may be determined by computing
    autocorrelation function of the <em>square</em> of the original
    time series.
