Features
--------

-   Estimation of embedding delay using autocorrelation, delayed mutual
    information, and reconstruction expansion.
-   Embedding dimension estimation using false nearest neighbors and
    averaged false neighbors.
-   Computation of correlation sum and correlation dimension from both
    scalar and vector time series.
-   Estimation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent from both scalar and
    vector time series.
-   Generation of FT, AAFT, and IAAFT surrogates from a scalar
    time series.
-   Simple noise reduction scheme for filtering deterministic
    time series.
-   Miscellaneous functions for end point correction, stationarity
    check, fast near neighbor search, etc.

Installation
------------

NoLiTSA can be installed using pip by running

    git clone https://github.com/manu-mannattil/nolitsa.git
    pip install ./nolitsa

or, with newer versions of pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/manu-mannattil/nolitsa.git

NoLiTSA requires NumPy and SciPy, and (theoretically) works with both
Python 2 and 3.

### Tests

NoLiTSA’s unit tests can be executed by running `nosetests`, or by using

    python setup.py test
