    This function implements the averaged false neighbors method
    described by Cao (1997) to estimate the minimum embedding dimension

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        1-D scalar time series.
    dim : int array (default = [1])
        Embedding dimensions for which E(d) and E^*(d) should be
        computed.
    tau : int, optional (default = 1)
        Time delay.
    metric : string, optional (default = 'chebyshev')
        Metric to use for distance computation.  Must be one of
        "cityblock" (aka the Manhattan metric), "chebyshev" (aka the
        maximum norm metric), or "euclidean".
    window : int, optional (default = 10)
        Minimum temporal separation (Theiler window) that should exist
        between near neighbors.
    maxnum : int, optional (default = None (optimum))
        Maximum number of near neighbors that should be found for each
        point.  In rare cases, when there are no neighbors that are at a
        nonzero distance, this will have to be increased (i.e., beyond
        2 * window + 3).
    parallel : bool, optional (default = True)
        Calculate E(d) and E^*(d) for each d in parallel.

    -------
    E : array
        E(d) for each of the d's.
    Es : array
        E^*(d) for each of the d's.

    Parameters
    ----------

        1-D real input array containing the time series.

    parallel : bool, optional (default = True)
        Calculate the fraction of false nearest neighbors for each d
        in parallel.

    Returns
    -------
    f1 : array
        Fraction of neighbors classified as false by Test I.
    f2 : array
        Fraction of neighbors classified as false by Test II.
    f3 : array
        Fraction of neighbors classified as false by either Test I
        or Test II.

    Notes
    -----
    The FNN fraction is metric depended for noisy time series.  In
    particular, the second FNN test, which measures the boundedness of
    the reconstructed attractor depends heavily on the metric used.
    E.g., if the Chebyshev metric is used, the near-neighbor distances
    in the reconstructed attractor are always bounded and therefore the
    reported FNN fraction becomes a nonzero constant (approximately)
    instead of increasing with the embedding dimension.
